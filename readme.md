# Eve O Profiles

Manages profiles for Eve O Preview. Because real pilots have multiple Eve O Preview Profiles....

The tool you never knew you wanted, but know you need.


# Installation

> Note I am using Windows Subsystem for Linux to run this, so most commands are unix based not powershell...

- Requires python3 (Maybe will make an executable in the future)... We will see...
- You should have venv installed [Look here for instructions](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/), but not required.
- Install tkinter `python3-tk` on linux.

If you have venv installed make sure to do `python3 -m venv venv` and then `venv\Scripts\activate` or linux `. venv/bin/activate`

Ok now run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

After that finishes do `python3 manager.py` and bob's your uncle.
